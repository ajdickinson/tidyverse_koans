  # In order to progress:
  # 1. Read all instructions carefully.
  # 2. When you come to an exercise, fill in the blank, un-comment the line
  #    (Ctrl/Cmd Shift C), and execute the code in the console
  #    (Ctrl/Cmd Return). If the piece of code spans multiple lines, highlight
  #    the whole chunk or simply put your cursor at the end of the last line.
  # 3. Test that your answers are correct (Ctrl/Cmd Shift T)
  # 4. Save (Ctrl/Cmd S).

  # In this class, we've learned a lot about two very important tidyverse
  # packages: 'dplyr' and 'ggplot2'. We'll spend the rest of the course
  # learning a third: 'purrr'. We'll only learn 3 functions from that
  # package, but they are deep concepts and really powerful tools. The
  # three functions are map(), reduce(), and accumulate().

  # This koan introduces map(), the next one gives you more practice using
  # it, and reduce() and accumulate() will come a little later in koans
  # 18-20.

  # Run this code to get started:

  library(tidyverse)
  library(gapminder)

  #                        ----- Vectorized Functions -----

  # Last week we learned we could define our own custom functions. Here I
  # define a function called 'pct_change' that takes two arguments: an "old"
  # value and a "new" value, and it returns the percentage change between
  # them.

  pct_change <- function(old, new) {
    (new - old) / old
  }

  # 1. Does 'pct_change' work on values? ---------------------------------------

  #1@

  # pct_change(__, __) == 1

  #@1


  # 2. Does 'pct_change' work on vectors? --------------------------------------

  #2@

  # pct_change(__, __) == c(0, 1, 2)

  #@2


  # How is it that 'pct_change' works on vectors? Well, 'pct_change' is defined
  # only using subtraction and division, which both work element-wise on
  # vectors. You can plug vectors directly into the computation that's done in
  # the function body:

  (c(4, 5, 6) - c(1, 2, 3)) / c(1, 2, 3)

  #                          ----- Example 1: rnorm -----

  # Most of the functions we've been using are "vectorized" (they work with
  # vectors of any length). But some functions may not work on vectors so
  # smoothly. And when you define your own custom functions that are more
  # complicated than `pct_change`, they oftentimes wonâ€™t work on vectors.

  # For example, take 'rnorm()'.

  # 3. Use 'rnorm()' to generate 10 random numbers from N(0, 1). ---------------

  #3@

  # rnorm(__, __, __)

  #@3


  # Suppose we have this task:
  # Generate 10 random numbers from N(0, 1),
  #          10 random numbers from N(0, 2),
  #          10 random numbers from N(0, 3),
  # all the way up to 10 random numbers from N(0, 100).

  # First attempt: try to put a vector into 'sd':
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1:100)

  # What happens? R generates one random number from N(0, 1), one random number
  # from N(0, 2), one random number from N(0, 3), all the way up to one random
  # number from N(0, 10). It stops at 10 because `n = 10`. `rnorm` is
  # vectorized, but not in the way that helps us solve this problem.

  # Second attempt: you could copy-paste 100 times, changing the sd each time:
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 2)
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 3)
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 4)
  #etc.

  # The problems with the copy-paste solution:
  #
  #   * contains a lot of extra unnecessary code for a reader to have to read
  #   * doesn't use the computer as the powerful tool it is
  #   * is annoying for you to have to write (and depending on the problem, may
  #       take you all day or even all week to type out!)


  # The correct solution: use map(.x, .f).

  # `map(.x, .f)` is from the package `purrr`, which is the last tidyverse
  # package we'll talk about in-depth. `purrr` is named the way it is because
  # it helps "make your functions purrr" like a well oiled machine. And that's
  # exactly what we need help with in the example above: `rnorm()` wasn't
  # purrring for us!

  # map(.x, .f) does one simple thing: It applies the function .f to each
  # element of the vector .x.

  # map(.x, .f) will return a list of the same length as .x. Check out the
  # diagram that explains visually how to use map():

  #' ![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f0494d020aa517ae7b1011cea4c4a9f21702df8b/2577b/diagrams/functionals/map.png)

  # The name `map` refers to how "map" is used in math: a mapping is an
  # operation that associates each element of a set with elements in a different
  # set. The `.x` are the inputs, and the `.f` is the function to apply to get
  # to the set of outputs.

  # So how do we use `map(.x, .f)` to solve our problem?


  # I like to write the beginning of the copy-paste version:
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 2)
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 3)

  # What should be the vector of inputs `.x`? It's whatever needed to change in
  # the code above. In that code, everything stayed the same except for the `sd`
  # needed to change: it needed to go from 1 to 100.

  # `.x` will be the vector 1:100.

  # What's the function `.f` we'll apply to every element of `.x`? It should
  # take a standard deviation as its argument, and it should output 10 ranom
  # normal numbers with a mean of zero and a standard deviation that is the
  # function argument:

  # function(.x) {
  #   rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = .x)
  # }

  # Use the tilde `~` for defining a function "formula-style" and referring to
  # .x directly in the map call:

  # map(.x = 1:100, .f = ~ rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = .x))

  # There are actually 3 ways to define the function `.f` inside a map call:

  #   * as a formula with the tilde `~`
  #   * as an anonymous (lambda) function
  #   * as a named function

  # All these options are pretty similar, so it comes down to personal
  # preference.

  # Using an anonymous function:

  # map(.x = 1:100, .f = function(input) rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = input))

  # Or use a named function:

  # rnorm_sd <- function(input) {
  #   rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = input)
  # }
  # map(.x = 1:100, .f = rnorm_sd)


  #                     ----- Example 2: reading csv files -----

  # Recall: in the murder mystery project, we had to read 8 different csv files,
  # and we did it one by one, because 'read_csv' takes just ONE csv file at a
  # time.

  # people <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/person.csv")
  # drivers_license <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/drivers_license.csv")
  # income <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/income.csv")
  # crime_scene_report <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/crime_scene_report.csv")
  # facebook_event_checkin <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/facebook_event_checkin.csv")
  # get_fit_now_checkin <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/get_fit_now_checkin.csv")
  # get_fit_now_member <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/get_fit_now_member.csv")
  # interview <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/interview.csv")

  # What if you had to read 100 or 1,000 csv's? You would *not* want to type
  # all that out!

  # `paste()` is vectorized in just the way we want. This generates the
  # character strings we need:

  paste(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/",
    c("person", "drivers_license", "income", "crime_scene_report"),
    ".csv",
    sep = ""
  )

  # But `read_csv()` is not vectorized. It takes only one csv file at a time,
  # and when we pass a vector in, it thinks the names of the files are the data
  # we're interested in.

  paste(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/",
    c("person", "drivers_license", "income", "crime_scene_report"),
    ".csv",
    sep = ""
  ) %>%
    read_csv()

  # Problem: `read_csv` doesn't purrr! Let's use `map(.x, .f)`

  # .x: the things we want to change. Here, that will be the string for
  # the csv file. .f: the function we want to apply to every element of `.x`.
  # Here that's just 'read_csv'.

  # map(
  #   .x = paste(
  #     "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobriant/dplyrmurdermystery/master/data/",
  #     c("person", "drivers_license", "income", "crime_scene_report"),
  #     ".csv", sep = ""
  #   ),
  #   .f = read_csv
  # )

  # It works! The output is a list of tibbles. From there, we could tell R how
  # to use `left_join` to combine them into a bigger tibble by their common
  # variables.

  #:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

  # Great work! You're one step closer to tidyverse enlightenment.
  # Make sure to return to this topic to meditate on it later.

  # If you're ready, you can move on to the next koan: more map().
