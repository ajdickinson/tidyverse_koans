# Tidyverse Koans: A Gentle Introduction to R for Economists (and other applied researchers)

Hi! My name is Colleen O'Briant, and I'm an economist working on my PhD at the University of Oregon. I wrote these koans for other budding applied researchers in the hopes of showing people that:

  1) Even if you've been discouraged before, building great data analytics skills is not something that's beyond you! ðŸ’ª
  2) The tidyverse is a joy. Beginners must be encouraged to appreciate elegant solutions and aesthetic code. That way, they start caring about things other than solving the problem as fast as possible. ðŸ’–
  5) You can use the tidyverse for a shockingly wide range of tasks. ðŸ’¯

To do these koans, you don't need any prior programming experience. The koans build slowly and steadily. They are a meditative journey toward tidyverse enlightenment.

What will you get out of this? All of the data analytics skills an economist might need. You'll learn to query your data, visualize it, model it, and even run simulations. You'll be able to use these koans as a jumping-off point for getting your own novel reasearch ideas up and running.

## Koans > Programming books

There are lots of great books about the tidyverse (R4DS and Advanced R come to mind for sure). But learning by doing is always the best way. If you want to learn something quickly and you want to learn it well, you have to jump in! Koans try to minimize learner frustration by making the questions fill-in-the-blank. I've conducted about 100 user interviews for these koans (I used them in labs while teaching my 400-level econometrics course). My students have found them to be highly effective and relatively painless.

## Koans > in-browser resources like datacamp or learnr

With koans, you're working in the development environment you'll use for your own projects (scripts inside RStudio). With datacamp or learnr, you're not. Transitioning from the browser to using scripts can be difficult for learners, so I think it's much better to teach them to write code in a script from the beginning.

## To summarize, koans are great because they:

  - Assume no previous experience
  - Build slowly to expose learners to the entire ecosystem
  - Have fast feedback cycles
  - Have opportunities to experiment
  - Are self-paced
  - Are free!
  
These koans are inspired by the spirit of the ruby/lisp/python/et al. koans, but they are tailored in every way for programming novices learning the tidyverse ecosystem. 

## Can I use or adapt these koans for my course or lab?

Absolutely, I would love that! I'd only ask for some sort of acknowledgment in your course materials.

## Getting started

#### 1. Install R and RStudio

#### 2. You'll need some packages

In RStudio, run these lines of code:

Install the tidyverse:

`install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)`

`library(tidyverse)`

Install gapminder (my favorite dataset for beginners):

`install.packages("gapminder")`

`library(gapminder)`

Install devtools and another package I developed called `qelp` (quick help) to be able to read my beginner-friendly help docs in RStudio:

`install.packages("devtools")`

`library(devtools)`

`install_github("cobriant/qelp")`

Now run:

`?qelp::install.packages`

If everything went right, the help docs I wrote on the function `install.packages` should pop up in the lower right hand pane.

#### 3. Install the koans

On this github page, click on the green button that says "`Code`" and then hit "`Download ZIP`".

Find the file (probably in your downloads folder) and open it to unzip it. Navigate to the new folder named "`tidyverse_koans-main`" and double click on the R project "`tidyversekoans.Rproj`". RStudio should open. If it doesn't, open RStudio and go to `File > Open Project` and then find `tidyversekoans.Rproj`.

In RStudio, go to the lower righthand panel and hit the folder "`R`". This takes you to the list of 20 koans. Open the first koan: `K01_vector.R`. Before you start, modify a keybinding:

Macs: `Tools > Modify keyboard shortcuts > Run a test file > Cmd Shift T`

Windows: `Tools > Modify keyboard shortcuts > Run a test file > Ctrl Shift T`

Now hit `Cmd/Ctrl Shift T`. You've just tested the first koan. You should see:

`[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 9 | PASS 0 ]`

What does this mean? If there are errors in your R script, the test will not complete. Since it completed, you know there are no errors. Since `FAIL` is 0, you also haven't failed any of the questions yet. But `PASS` is also 0, so you haven't passed the questions either. Since they're blank right now, the test will skip them. That's why `SKIP` is 9.

Go ahead and start working on the koans and learning about the tidyverse! When you're finished with a koan and the tests pass, it can nice to be able to see your work in a compiled html document (Ctrl/Cmd Shift K).

## Outline for instructors

- [K01_vector.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K01_vector.R) The way learners should think about data in R is that data is held in vectors. Did you know that even a single number like `4` is a vector in R, of length 1? Starting with vectors gets them familiar with the concept of functions being vectorized (many functions work on vectors of any length). This is a powerful first building block for the tidyverse's functional, declarative approach. It's a cardinal sin to let learners believe they need to do something as complicated as looping or mapping over a vector when the function they're applying is already vectorized.
  
- [K02_tibble.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K02_tibble.R) The tidyverse's spreadsheet. Data is still being held in vectors (column vectors specifically). The **tidied data format** is where columns are variables and rows are observations.
  
- [K03_pipe.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K03_pipe.R) The most commonly used function in the tidyverse.

- [K04_dplyr1.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K04_dplyr1.R) The first 3 `dplyr` functions to learn are filter(), select(), and mutate(). Tidyverse literature talks about using `dplyr` to "manipulate" data. I don't like that. I think it's a lot more useful for learners to think about using `dplyr` for writing *queries* on their data, like with SQL. That way, they remember that if they have a question about their data, they should reach for `dplyr`.
 
- [K05_dplyr2.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K05_dplyr2.R) The next two `dplyr` functions are summarize() and group_by().

- [K06_dplyr3.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K06_dplyr3.R) The final two `dplyr` functions are arrange() and slice().

- [K07_left_join.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K07_left_join.R) One more function from `dplyr`: use `left_join` to combine two tibbles when you have a variable that acts as a key to match them. This koan sets learners up to solve [the dplyr murder mystery I adapted from here](https://github.com/speegled/dplyrmurdermystery/). This project has historically been a favorite: to quote my teaching evaluations, "The assignments have been manageable by breaking concepts into steps that are simpler. The murder mystery proj was even enjoyable."

- [K08_qplot_to_ggplot.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K08_qplot_to_ggplot.R) Koans 8-11 shift the focus from `dplyr` to `ggplot2`. In this koan, I've given learners some exposure to `qplot` in their homework, and I introduce some `ggplot2` syntax by drawing comparisons between `qplot` and `ggplot2`.
  
- [K09_ggplot_aes.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K09_ggplot_aes.R) `aes()`: what's it for?

- [K10_ggplot_geom.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K10_ggplot_geom.R) histograms, density plots, vertical and horizontal lines and annotations, scatterplots, boxplots, and animations!

- [K11_lm.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K11_lm.R) This koan is a refresher and a reminder for learners about running regressions in R, especially using `lm()` to get an R-squared, the fitted values and residuals, doing log or squared transformations of variables inside the `lm()` call, interactions, etc.

- [K12_stats.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K12_stats.R) Exploring the normal distribution, Student's t distribution, and F distribution in R. Randomly generate numbers from each of these distributions. Visualize a hypothesis test from each of these distributions using `ggplot`.

- [K13_functions.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K13_functions.R) Learn to write your own functions.

- [K14_functions_dplyr.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K14_functions_dplyr.R) It's fun and valuable to be able to write your own functions on top of tidyverse code that use env-variables just like in `dplyr` or `ggplot2`. The error is cryptic (`object not found`), but the solution is simple (`{{ vars }}`). `dplyr` vignettes call this ["indirection"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/programming.html).

- [K15_map.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K15_map.R)  Map: what to do when the functions you want to apply aren't vectorized in the way you want. `map(.x, .f)` is declarative. The imperative analog is a `for` loop. I don't think it's useful to teach students both `map` and `for` loops when they're learning the tidyverse. The first reason is that we want to stay as declarative as possible for consistency. The second reason is that this concept can be difficult, so being given two ways to solve the problem can be really confusing. I'd much rather have learners gain confidence with one way first.

- [K16_more_map.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K16_more_map.R) Use `map(.x, .f)` to do monte carlo simulations with elegance.

- [K17_lag.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K17_lag.R) By this time in my class, we've transitioned to time series models, where lags are important to be able to compute.

- [K18_first_differences.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K18_first_differences.R) Use lags to "first difference" variables in your data and visualize the results in a ggplot with two sets of vertical axis labels.

- [K19_reduce.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K19_reduce.R) Reduce is a powerful functional programming concept. I like to go over the [pictures in Adv-R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html#reduce) in lecture before learners attempt these last two koans. This concept isn't difficult, but does require a little focused attention.

- [K20_accumulate.R](https://github.com/cobriant/tidyverse_koans/blob/main/R/K20_accumulate.R) I provide an example of how to use `reduce` (and its extension `accumulate`) to generate a random walk and then an autocorrelated series.
