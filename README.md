# tidyverse koans

Koans are a great way to learn to program because:

  - You work in the development environment you'll use (R scripts in RStudio), not in a separate online environment like in Datacamp or LearnR
  - Feedback is immediate (Ctrl/Cmd Shift T to test your answers)
  - The koans are self-paced
  - You're free to experiment in the console
  
It's important to remember koans are not worksheets to be completed for speed. Studying koans is a slow, meditative journey toward tidyverse enlightenment.

# Getting started

#### 1. Clone this package (download the code) and open it in RStudio

#### 2. You'll need tidyverse, devtools, gapminder, and qelp

`install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)`

`library(tidyverse)`

`install.packages("devtools")`

`library(devtools)`

`install.packages("gapminder")`

`install_github("cobriant/qelp")`

#### 3. Modify a keybinding for easy testing

Macs:
Tools > Modify keyboard shortcuts > Run a test file > Cmd Shift T

Windows:
Tools > Modify keyboard shortcuts > Run a test file > Ctrl Shift T

#### 4. Open the first koan `R/K01_vector.R` and get to work!
